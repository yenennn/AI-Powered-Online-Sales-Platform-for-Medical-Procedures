This project aims to develop an AI-driven online platform for the sale of medical procedures, integrating multilingual communication, price negotiation, and human intervention capabilities. <br />

## Project Description:<br />
This project aims to develop an AI-driven online platform for the sale of medical procedures, integrating multilingual communication, price negotiation, and human intervention capabilities. The system will facilitate seamless interactions between potential clients and medical professionals while optimizing sales through intelligent bargaining and communication management.<br />

## Key Features:<br />

#### 1.	Multilingual Communication:<br />
- The AI system will support a predefined set of languages, starting with English. <br />
- It will ensure smooth and accurate translation between patients and medical professionals. <br />

#### 2.	Medical Procedure Catalog: <br />
- A structured database of medical procedures with associated details such as descriptions, prerequisites, risks, and recovery information.<br />
- Multiple doctors associated with each procedure, allowing patients to select from a list of available professionals.<br />
- The system should be able to sell medical procedures for configurable doctors, meaning that conversation flows and sales strategies will be doctor-specific.<br />

#### 3.	Dynamic Pricing and Bargaining:<br />
-	Each procedure will have a fixed base price and a negotiable price range.<br />
-	The AI system will engage in price negotiations with potential clients to maximize sales revenue within the defined bargain limits.<br />
-	Pricing and negotiation strategies will be doctor-specific, ensuring flexibility based on individual practitioner preferences.<br />

#### 5.	AI-Driven Sales Optimization:<br />
-	The AI will utilize sales strategies to maximize conversions, such as personalized recommendations, upselling, and data-driven negotiation tactics.<br />
-	It will analyze customer interactions and adapt communication strategies accordingly.<br />
-	The AI will tailor its conversation approach based on the selected doctor’s preferences and specialties.<br />

#### 6.	Human Assistance Escalation:<br />
-	The AI system will detect cases where human intervention is necessary and seamlessly forward the conversation to a human representative.<br />
-	Criteria for escalation may include complex medical inquiries, legal concerns, or stalled negotiations.<br />

#### 7.	Doctor-Specific Conversations:<br />
-	Conversations will be tailored to each doctor’s specific procedures, pricing policies, and consultation styles.<br />
-	The AI system will ensure that each doctor’s availability, terms, and procedural details are accurately represented.<br />

#### 8.	Document Management and Access:<br />
-	Secure storage and retrieval of medical procedure documents.<br />
-	Patients and doctors can access necessary medical records, consents, and procedural guidelines within the platform.<br />

#### 9.	Compliance and Security:<br />
-	Ensuring compliance with medical and data privacy regulations (such as HIPAA and GDPR).<br />
-	Secure handling of user data, financial transactions, and communication records.<br />

## Expected Outcomes:<br />
-	A fully functional AI-powered sales platform for medical procedures.<br />
-	Increased conversion rates and sales revenue through intelligent AI-driven negotiations.<br />
-	Seamless communication in multiple languages with support for human intervention when necessary.<br />
